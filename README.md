# Password-Generator
Generally, while we make our account on any online platform. We need to make a strong password for our account.
Generally, at that moment we canâ€™t think of different patterns of passwords instantly.
But, it is not the same case with computers. 
Computers can generate random and strong passwords based on our customizations in seconds.

In this repo. I made a simple random password generator which take the length of passwrod as input and generate the random password.
